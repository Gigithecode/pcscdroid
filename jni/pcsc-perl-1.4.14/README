Perl interface to the PC/SC smart card library
==============================================

This package contains a Perl wrapper to the PC/SC smartcard library
(pcsc-lite) [1] from MUSCLE [2] together with some small examples.

You can find applications using this wrapper in the pcsc-tools package
[3].

Build and Install:
==================

A very quick documentation on how to build and install the wrapper.

$ perl Makefile.PL
$ make

Insert a smart card in the (first) PCSC reader

$ make test
$ sudo make install


Remarks:
========

For Windows users:

Status behaves different on Unix and from Win32
	it returns the Atr len
	it does not return any error like

     . Transmit(): return (undef) if the protocol is not defined. This
       happens if you change a T=0 card with a T=1 (or vice versa) and

    - add two constant definitions in PCSC.pm. Thanks to Ville Skyttä

1.1.2 - 28 Aug 2002, Ludovic ROUSSEAU
